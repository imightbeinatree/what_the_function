= What the Function

a programmer's programming language thesaurus

There is a sample db file in the db folder, a .sql file for mysql called whatfunction_development.sql, you can use this file to get up and going pretty quick with a bit of sample data to see how it works.  There is a list of TODOS and bugs/problems below if you want to work on something, but send a message to me on github if you really do plan to work on something because right now we ain't got no trac and while do got some rspec, it all sucks, it sucks so bad we might as well not have any rspec at all.

This is a wiki-style website where you can enter and find information about equivalent functions or methods between different programming languages that we call synonyms. So if you are working in an unfamiliar programming language but you know another language pretty well, look up the and methods you do know and find synonyms in the language you are working in.

What Function is super pre alpha
There are lots of little issues and big issues, but feel free to poke around.

there is no login, just wiki style history of everything and no delete, i think this is a good way, people's ip addresses show in the history areas, but thats it, and those are easy to fake for those that care to hide it, i dont think i want to add any form of login, lets just keep it open

Big TODOS
- fix whole area around adding synonyms - drop downs that you type into the box and select from the pop up that results from a search of function and language names, perhaps first x chars of description, theres a plugin or gem for this
- make the history for anything just ajax in with a pop over div instead of going to a new page, maybe grey the screen maybe not
- block all the unwanted routes like delete except give admins a way to do it (upgrade to rails 2.2 to get only and except routing)
- check all forms for formatting, component usability, proper error handling, and taking you back to the right places
- a design
- some content for those big blank empty spaces on some of those pages, like the list of functions for a language page
- any other features? - hot languages, hot functions, a cloud of some sort (man i hate tag clouds, but boy do people seem to love 'em)
- some kind of admin other than straight db access
- any way to just import a large number of functions from a wide array of languages?
- tests! rspec, shoulda, whatever, just need some tests

Known Bugs/Problems
- - when editing a function from a synonym page you end up back on that function page instead of the synonym page you started on (such as editing substr when you are here http://0.0.0.0:3000/programming_languages/Javascript/what_functions/substring/and/PHP/substr by clicking edit in the right hand box and ending up here http://0.0.0.0:3000/programming_languages/PHP/what_functions/substr)
- - select menus for choosing programming language do not lead with a blank choose one option and are not sorted in alpha order
- - list of languages on home page is not sorted in alpha order
- - there is an issue when you try to make a function have a name that contains a . because we are using the name field as a param for urls, and it thinks its a format, example: i want my Ruby functions to include the class they belong to, like I want an entry for String.slice and Array.slice but if I make the what_function[:name] value String.slice the routes don't work
